This is a modified version of the official code.  
1. Articles are generated starting from leaf section nodes. Non-leaf section nodes are generated by summarizing leaf section nodes. Then the leaf section node will be removed. The generated article will retain the outline structure except leaf section node.  
2. Using SearXNG search engine and deepseek-v3 model.

Due to the recent high volume of visitors, search API quota limitations, you may encounter an error:```'ValueError: Expected 2D array, got 1D array instead: array=[]. Reshape your data either using array.reshape(-1, 1) if your data has a single feature or array.reshape(1, -1) if it contains a single sample.'```If this error occurs, please try again in a few hours.

## 📖 Quick Start

- 🌏 The **Online Demo** is avaiable at [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/studios/iic/OmniThink) now！

# 📌 Introduction

Welcome to **OmniThink**, an innovative machine writing framework designed to replicate the human cognitive process of iterative expansion and reflection in generating insightful long-form articles. 

- **Iterative Expansion and Reflection**: OmniThink uses a unique mechanism that simulates human cognitive behaviors to deepen the understanding of complex topics.
- **Enhanced Knowledge Density**: OmniThink focuses on expanding knowledge boundaries, resulting in articles that are rich in information and insights.
- **Comprehensive Article Generation**: OmniThink constructs outlines and generates articles, delivering high-quality content that is both coherent and contextually robust.

# 🛠 Dependencies

```bash
conda create -n OmniThink python=3.11
git clone https://github.com/zjunlp/OmniThink.git
cd OmniThink
# Install requirements
pip install -r requirement.txt

```
🔑 Before running, please export the OPENAI API key or Dashscope API key and SEARCH key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
export SEARCHKEY=YOUR_SEARCHKEY
```

or

```bash
export DASHSCOPE_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
export SEARCHKEY=YOUR_SEARCHKEY
```
> You can define your own [LLM API](https://github.com/zjunlp/OmniThink/blob/main/src/tools/lm.py) and [SEARCH API](https://github.com/zjunlp/OmniThink/blob/main/src/tools/rm.py)

> Note that the output of the LLM should be a LIST.

# Results in OmniThink
The preformance of OmniThink is shown below:

# Generate Article in OmniThink
Just one command required
```bash
sh run.sh
```
You can find your Article, Outline and mindmap in ./results/

# 🔍 Evaluation

We are organizing the evaluation code and will open source it soon.
