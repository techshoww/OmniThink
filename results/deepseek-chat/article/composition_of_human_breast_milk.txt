# Introduction

Human breast milk (HBM) is a vital and complex biological fluid that serves as the optimal source of nutrition for infants, supporting their growth, development, and overall health. It is composed of a diverse array of nutrients and bioactive compounds that are essential for meeting the physiological needs of newborns. The composition of HBM is typically categorized into three main groups: micronutrients, macronutrients, and bioactives[1]. Micronutrients, including vitamins and minerals, are critical for metabolic functions and are detailed in 28 research articles[1]. Macronutrients, which encompass carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, are explored in 57 articles, emphasizing their role in providing energy and supporting tissue growth[1]. Additionally, 75 articles focus on bioactives, such as immunoglobulins, enzymes, and growth factors, which contribute significantly to immune protection and developmental processes[1]. Beyond its nutritional value, HBM contains bioactive factors that influence the infant's immune system, gut health, and overall well-being, making it uniquely suited to meet the multifaceted needs of infants[1][2]. This comprehensive composition highlights the indispensable role of HBM in infant nutrition and health.

# Macronutrients

Human breast milk contains essential macronutrients—carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids—that support infant growth and development. Carbohydrates, primarily lactose, provide energy and aid in central nervous system development, while human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) promote gut health and immune defense[1]. Proteins, including casein and whey, supply amino acids and enhance immunity, with immunoglobulins playing a key role in pathogen neutralization[1][2]. Lipids, predominantly triglycerides, are crucial for neurodevelopment and energy, with omega-3 fatty acids like DHA contributing to brain and eye health[3][4]. Together, these macronutrients form a balanced nutritional profile tailored to infant needs.

## Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are a major component of human breast milk, providing essential energy and supporting infant development. The primary carbohydrate in breast milk is lactose, which constitutes approximately 6.7 to 7.7 grams per 100 milliliters and serves as the dominant source of energy for infants[1]. Lactose also plays a critical role in the development of the central nervous system and is positively correlated with other macronutrients, such as fat and protein, indicating its integral role in the balanced nutritional profile of breast milk[1].
In addition to lactose, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are another significant carbohydrate component, representing the third most abundant solid constituent in breast milk after lactose and lipids[1]. HMOs are complex, indigestible carbohydrates that perform crucial functions in infant health. They exhibit a prebiotic effect by promoting the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, such as *Bifidobacterium* and *Lactobacillus*[1]. Furthermore, HMOs act as pathogen decoys, reducing the infectivity of harmful microorganisms by preventing their adhesion to the infant's gut lining[1]. Research also suggests that HMOs enhance the immune system, contributing to the infant's defense against infections[1]. The specific mechanisms by which HMOs exert these effects remain an active area of study, underscoring their importance in early-life nutrition and immunity[1]. Together, lactose and HMOs highlight the multifaceted role of carbohydrates in breast milk, ensuring optimal infant growth and health.

## Proteins

Proteins are a fundamental component of human breast milk, playing essential roles in infant nutrition, growth, and immune defense. The primary proteins in breast milk are casein and whey proteins, which together account for the majority of the protein content. Casein constitutes approximately 40% of the total protein in human breast milk[1]. It is crucial for providing essential amino acids and is more rapidly absorbed by infants compared to cow milk casein or soy protein, making it highly bioavailable[1]. Whey proteins, on the other hand, are the dominant protein fraction, comprising 60-80% of the total protein content in mature milk[1]. Within the whey protein group, alpha-lactalbumin is the most abundant, representing 20-25% of the total whey protein content[1]. Other significant whey proteins include lactoferrin, immunoglobulins, and serum albumin, which contribute to antimicrobial activity, immune defense, and the growth of beneficial gut bacteria such as bifidobacteria[1][2].
Immunoglobulins, a subset of proteins in breast milk, are particularly vital for infant immunity. Secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies are the most prevalent immunoglobulin in breast milk, providing protection at mucosal surfaces like the intestine[1]. These antibodies are resistant to enzymatic degradation, allowing them to neutralize pathogens effectively and prevent infections[1]. Additionally, IgG and IgM immunoglobulins are present, further enhancing the infant's immune response[1]. The presence of these immunoglobulins has been linked to a significant reduction in the incidence of infections such as diarrhea, respiratory infections, and otitis media in breastfed infants[1]. The unique composition and functional properties of breast milk proteins underscore their critical role in supporting infant health and development.

## Lipids

Lipids are a major component of human breast milk, primarily consisting of triglycerides, fatty acids, and cholesterol, which collectively play a vital role in infant nutrition and development. Triglycerides constitute approximately 98% of the total fat content in breast milk and are composed of three fatty acids esterified to a glycerol backbone[1]. These fatty acids include saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), with long-chain PUFAs (LCPUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) being particularly critical for neurodevelopment during infancy[2][3]. The composition of triglycerides can vary based on maternal diet, genetics, and lactation stage, but they consistently serve as a primary energy source and contribute to the infant's brain and tissue development[1][3].
Omega-3 fatty acids, such as DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), are essential components of breast milk lipids, playing a significant role in brain development, cognitive function, and eye health[4]. These fatty acids are primarily derived from the mother's diet, with sources like fatty fish, nuts, seeds, and plant oils being rich in omega-3s[5]. The concentration of omega-3s in breast milk varies depending on maternal intake, with higher maternal consumption correlating with increased levels in breast milk[6]. This underscores the importance of maternal nutrition in optimizing the lipid composition of breast milk for infant health[6][7].
Cholesterol, another key lipid in breast milk, is present in concentrations of approximately 10–20 mg/dL, though this can vary based on maternal factors such as diet and lactation stage[8]. Cholesterol is essential for the formation of cell membranes, brain development, and the synthesis of steroid hormones. Unlike other lipid components, cholesterol levels in breast milk are relatively stable and less influenced by dietary changes[9]. Research suggests that the cholesterol in breast milk may contribute to healthy lipid metabolism in infants, potentially reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases later in life[10]. Together, these lipid components highlight the complexity and nutritional importance of human breast milk in supporting infant growth and development.

# Micronutrients

Human breast milk provides a rich supply of micronutrients, including vitamins and minerals, essential for infant health and development. Fat-soluble vitamins like E and A, along with water-soluble varieties, support immune function and cellular protection[1]. Minerals such as calcium, iron, and zinc are crucial for bone development, metabolic processes, and physiological functions, with their concentrations influenced by maternal nutrition and lactation stage[1]. These micronutrients collectively ensure optimal growth and well-being during infancy.

## Vitamins

Human breast milk contains a comprehensive array of vitamins, categorized into fat-soluble and water-soluble types, which are essential for infant growth and development. Fat-soluble vitamins, including Vitamins E and A (retinol), are prominent in breast milk. Vitamin E is the most abundant fat-soluble vitamin, with concentrations ranging from 2 to 4 mg/L [1]. Retinol, though present in significant quantities, is less concentrated than Vitamin E and plays a critical role in supporting immune function, vision, and cellular health [1]. These vitamins are vital for protecting cells from oxidative damage and promoting overall infant health.

## Minerals

Human breast milk contains several essential minerals critical for infant growth, development, and physiological functions. Calcium, a key mineral, is present in concentrations typically ranging between 25 to 35 mg per 100 mL[1]. Its bioavailability is enhanced by components such as lactose in breast milk, facilitating efficient absorption and utilization by the infant’s body, which is crucial for bone and teeth development, as well as nerve and muscle function[1]. Iron, another vital micronutrient, varies in concentration based on maternal health and nutrition. In non-anemic mothers, iron levels in breast milk range from 0.89 mg/L to 0.26 mg/L from birth to six months postpartum, while anemic mothers exhibit similar ranges, starting from 0.86 mg/L and decreasing over the same period[1]. Zinc, essential for immune function and cellular metabolism, is found in breast milk at concentrations typically between 1 to 3 mg/L globally[1]. Zinc levels decline over the course of lactation, with higher concentrations in colostrum compared to mature milk, reflecting the infant’s evolving nutritional needs[1]. Maternal zinc intake and supplementation can influence the zinc content in breast milk, emphasizing the importance of maternal nutrition during lactation[1]. Together, these minerals play indispensable roles in ensuring optimal infant health and development.

# Bioactive Components

# Factors Influencing Composition

# Factors Influencing Composition

The composition of human breast milk is influenced by a variety of factors, including maternal health, stage of lactation, infant feeding patterns, and environmental exposures. Colostrum, produced in the first few days postpartum, is rich in immunoglobulins, white blood cells, and antibodies, providing critical immune support to the newborn[1]. It contains high levels of proteins, vitamins, and minerals but is lower in fat and lactose compared to mature milk[1]. By the end of the first week postpartum, milk transitions to a more mature form, which is thinner and whiter, with elevated lactose and fat concentrations to meet the infant’s growth and energy needs[1]. Infants also influence milk composition through their feeding behaviors and developmental demands[1].

Environmental factors, such as exposure to industrial chemicals, pesticides, water contaminants, and soil pollution, can alter breast milk quality. Studies have demonstrated the presence of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and heavy metals in breast milk, which are linked to environmental contamination[2]. These substances, when ingested or absorbed by the mother, can transfer to the infant, potentially posing cumulative health risks[2]. Monitoring and mitigating environmental exposures are essential to ensuring the safety and nutritional integrity of breast milk[1].

# Dynamic Composition and Adaptability

# Dynamic Composition and Adaptability

The composition of human breast milk is highly dynamic, varying not only during a single feeding session but also over time to adapt to the infant's evolving needs. During a single feed, milk transitions from "foremilk" to "hindmilk." Foremilk, produced at the beginning of a feed, is more watery and contains higher levels of lactose and proteins, which help quench the infant’s thirst. Hindmilk, produced later in the feeding, is richer in fat and provides the majority of the calories necessary for growth and development, ensuring a balanced intake of nutrients[1].

Breast milk also changes over time in response to factors such as the infant’s developmental stage, maternal health, and external circumstances like illness. For example, its composition adapts to better meet the infant’s nutritional and immunological requirements during periods of illness[1]. Colostrum, the first milk produced after birth, is particularly rich in antibodies and bioactive compounds, offering essential protection against infections and supporting gut health in newborns[1]. As lactation progresses, the milk’s composition shifts to provide higher energy content and essential nutrients to sustain rapid growth[2].

Maternal nutrition plays a critical role in shaping breast milk quality, with deficiencies potentially leading to long-term impacts on child health outcomes, such as developmental delays and reduced productivity in later life[3]. This adaptability ensures that breast milk remains the ideal source of nutrition for infants, offering both immediate and long-term health benefits tailored to their specific needs.

# Comparative Analysis

# Comparative Analysis

Human breast milk, cow’s milk, and formula milk differ significantly in their composition, nutritional content, and biological benefits for infants. Human breast milk is uniquely tailored to meet the needs of human infants, containing an optimal balance of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. For example, breast milk has a lower protein content (approximately 0.9-1.2 g/100 mL) compared to cow’s milk (3.3 g/100 mL)[1], with a higher proportion of whey proteins that are easier for infants to digest[2]. Breast milk also contains essential bioactive components, such as immunoglobulins, enzymes, and growth factors, which support immune system development and protect against infections[3]. Additionally, the carbohydrate profile of breast milk includes lactose (approximately 7 g/100 mL) and human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which promote gut health and beneficial microbiota[4].

In contrast, cow’s milk is designed to support the rapid growth of calves and contains higher levels of casein proteins, which are harder for human infants to digest[5]. Cow’s milk also lacks the bioactive components found in breast milk, making it less suitable as a primary source of nutrition for infants under 12 months[6]. Formula milk, while a safe alternative to breast milk, is manufactured to provide a standardized nutrient profile that supports basic growth and development. However, it does not replicate the dynamic and adaptive nature of breast milk[7]. For instance, formula milk often includes added vitamins and minerals but lacks HMOs and other bioactive compounds that are naturally present in breast milk[8]. Studies indicate that while formula-fed infants can grow and thrive, they may not receive the same immune-boosting and long-term health benefits associated with breastfeeding[9]. The choice between these milk sources often depends on individual circumstances, including maternal health, lifestyle, and medical needs[10].

These studies highlight the dynamic nature of breast milk and its nutritional significance, contributing to a deeper understanding of its unique properties. Ongoing research continues to explore new aspects of breast milk composition, aiming to elucidate its full range of benefits for infant growth and immunity [1].

# Cultural and Societal Perspectives

# Cultural and Societal Perspectives

Cultural and societal factors significantly influence attitudes and practices related to the composition of human breast milk and breastfeeding. Across different regions, breastfeeding rates vary widely due to cultural norms, economic conditions, and the availability of healthcare support. For example, in some cultures, breastfeeding is deeply rooted in tradition and widely practiced, while in others, societal pressures or lack of education hinder its adoption[1]. The Global Breastfeeding Scorecard highlights disparities in exclusive breastfeeding rates, with some low- and middle-income countries achieving rates as high as 60%, compared to lower rates in high-income countries[2].

Public health campaigns have sought to address these disparities by promoting the nutritional benefits of breast milk, which contains essential nutrients, antibodies, and bioactive components crucial for infant development[3]. However, the effectiveness of these campaigns often depends on cultural acceptance and the strength of local healthcare systems[4]. Additionally, the marketing of breastmilk substitutes by commercial entities has further complicated societal perspectives, often leading to misconceptions about the superiority of formula over breast milk[5]. Advocacy efforts, such as the Global Breastfeeding Collective’s Breastfeeding Advocacy Toolkit, aim to counteract these challenges by fostering societal support for breastfeeding and strengthening policies to protect it[6].

# Environmental and Sustainability Aspects

# Environmental and Sustainability Aspects

Breastfeeding offers significant environmental and sustainability benefits compared to formula feeding, primarily due to its minimal resource consumption and lower carbon footprint. Breastmilk production relies on the mother's natural lactation process, which does not require industrial processing, packaging, or transportation, unlike infant formula. Formula production involves energy-intensive manufacturing, dairy farming, and the use of plastic and metal for packaging, all of which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions[1]. Quantitative studies highlight that formula feeding can increase the carbon footprint by up to 20 times compared to breastfeeding, depending on the production and distribution practices of formula manufacturers[1]. Additionally, the absence of industrial processing in breastfeeding reduces environmental strain by eliminating the need for resource-intensive operations such as milk extraction, sterilization, and long-distance transportation[1]. These factors make breastfeeding a more sustainable feeding option, aligning with broader environmental goals by minimizing ecological impact and resource consumption.
